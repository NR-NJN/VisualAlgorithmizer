# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualization
This website was created as a quick refresher and revision system for my NYU Algorithms course. As I progress I will be adding more and more features/structures with higher levels of functionality to the wesbite<br>
You can find the website here : https://visualalgorithmizer.vercel.app/

**Kindly hold off on the Dijkstra for now**

Below are a few operations that have been incorporated into the website. The static screenshot does not capture the animations, but this should be enough to show off some basic features
## Array Operations
**Search operation**

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. This project relies on the Node.js runtime environment.

You can download the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installation and Setup

Follow these commands in your terminal to set up the project.

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NR-NJN/VisualAlgorithmizer.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Launching the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local web server.

1.  **Run the server**
    ```bash
    node local-server.js
    ```

2.  **View in your browser**
    
    **http://localhost:3000**
